# Introduction to Python
## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its easy-to-read syntax and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

## How Python Works
Python code is executed by an interpreter, which reads and executes the code line by line. This makes debugging easier and development faster.

## What is Python Used For?
- **Web Development**: Frameworks like Django and Flask
- **Data Science**: Libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: Libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn
- **Automation**: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks
